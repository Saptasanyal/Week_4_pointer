// Q5: Is the following program snippet correct?

// int a = 10, b = 20;
// int *ptr;
// *ptr = 5;

//The original code snippet is incorrect due to the dereferencing 
//of an uninitialized pointer. Initializing the pointer with a 
//valid memory address before dereferencing it corrects the issue.
